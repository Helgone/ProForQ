    "The goal of this tutorial is to present the features of the European labor market in Python consistently and with commentary. From a programming side, the main objective was working with data. From an economic side, the main objective was implementing an economic model and using programming to demonstrate features otherwise more difficult to demonstrate.\n",

    "This tutorial will focus mainly on the learnings from a programming perspective. However, this introduction will set up the background from an economic side to orientate the reader. There will be additional economic commentary throughout the sections."

Its responsability is to provide statistical information to the institutions of the European Union and to encourage the harmonisation of statistical methods in order to ease comparison between data.
